How do I approach designing software?

I approached designing software using key design skills that I learned in software development which include user interface design, system architecture design, and 
the ability to analyze and prioritize project requirements. I gathered and analyzed program requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of what was expected. Next, 

I created diagrams outlining the structure of the software. I developed a more detailed design. I, then iterated on the design based on feedback from the instructor. 
The design skills that I have developed can be applied in future work assignments in the way I approach solving complex problems.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approached developing programs by using different development strategies. I used component- based architecture which allowed for modular and reusable code. I used 
test-driven development(TDD) to ensure code reliability and maintainability. I developed the M code, iterated through different versions adding features and ensuring 
the project was aligned with user requirements. My approach to code development evolved significantly throughout the different milestones and I became more conscious 
of code readability and code organization. I can see a pathway for using this knowledge in my future. I am very interested in learning more about computer graphics. 

How has computer science helped me reach my goals?
Computational graphics and visualization can be applied in my future educational pathway by enhancing my understanding of complex mathematical concepts and 
algorithms. The professional pathways are open due to skills for creating 3D environments. Problem solving skills and algorithms can be used in various professions.
